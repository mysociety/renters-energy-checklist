    <h2 class="mt-4">Your EPC rating is on the borderline</h2>

    <p>By law, private rental properties must have an EPC rating of E or above. Your home has a rating of E … but as many as 5% of EPCs are actually incorrect.</p>
    <p>If your EPC is one of them, your landlord could be required to cover the cost of energy efficiency improvements, to bring your home’s EPC grade back up to an E.</p>
    <p>As your EPC was measured using the less accurate “RdSAP” methodology, it is <em>even more likely</em> to be incorrect.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Things to check</h2>

    <h3>Floor area</h3>
    <h4>What to check:</h4>
    <p>That your floor area is accurate</p>
    <h4>Why it matters</h4>
    <p>A 3% change in floor area is enough to alter the majority of EPC scores – even as little as 1% could mean your home is of a lower grade than expected, potentially requiring your landlord to cover the cost of energy efficiency measures.</p>

    <h3>Insulation</h3>
    <h4>What to check:</h4>
    <p>That the roof, wall, and floor insulation listed on your EPC certificate is correct. <a href="#">Find out how to check your insulation.</a></p>
    <h4>Why it matters</h4>
    <p>Unscrupulous EPC assessors will often fail to correctly check the type of insluation used in inaccessible parts of your home. If your home lacks insulation that the assessor assumed was there, this could mean your home is of a lower grade than expected, potentially requiring your landlord to cover the cost of energy efficiency measures.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>

    <p>If you’ve found inaccuracies, we’d encourage you to <a href="#">find your local tenant support group</a>, for advice on challenging your EPC rating.</p>
    <p>Good landlords will be happy to make changes that meet legal requirements – but bad landlords might use this as an excuse to raise the rent. <a href="#">Our step-by-step guide</a> can help you work out whether to push for better energy efficiency, in your particular situation.</p>

    <h2 class="h1">Energy prices are soaring, and if you rent it can be harder to work out what you can do about it.</h2>
    <p>The energy efficiency of your home can play a massive part in your energy costs. Your home should have an EPC certificate which shows its energy efficiency on an A–G scale, along with steps you can take to improve it.</p>
